# Daily Quant / ML Practice Log

This repository is a **daily practice workspace** where I experiment with ideas related to:

- Quantitative trading
- Market microstructure
- Machine learning for financial data
- Performance-oriented implementations (Python ↔ C++ / Rust)

The focus is on **learning by building**, not on producing a finished product.
